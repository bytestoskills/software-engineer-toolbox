# Let's Grow Together.

## What This Repo Is About

This is a collection of hard-earned lessons, sharp tools, habits, systems, and real-world strategies to help software engineers grow, not just in code, but in career.  
Whether you're aiming for cleaner systems or clearer communication, you'll find something here to level up how you think, build, and lead.

## How to Make the Most of This Repo

Start with whatever grabs your attention, maybe it's debugging, maybe it's writing better emails, or 1:1s. Each page is designed to stand on its own, so you don’t need to read them in order or all at once.
Skim, learn, try something. Come back later when you're stuck or bored or chasing that next promotion.

## A Little Gift for Your Curiosity

First of all, sorry for this ad. We hate ads, too.
We’re engineers, so let’s skip the marketing fluff.
Over the years, we found that what moved the needle in our careers wasn’t just code. It was how we communicated, learned, made decisions, and handled complexity.
The little gift for your curiosity? A bundle of 7 skills we wish we had learned earlier. It takes less time to complete than a book, and it’s actually cheaper and more engaging.

## Table of Contents

This repo is organized into two main folders: `career` and `technical`.  

### Career

#### [The Anatomy of a Great Tech Resume](./career/tech-resume.md)  
*Spoiler: Most resumes get skimmed, ignored, or trashed. Here’s how to make yours stand out without sounding like a robot.*

#### [Technical Leadership: What Really Matters](./career/tech-leadership.md)  
*Spoiler: It’s not your title or how many meetings you attend. It’s what you do when systems break and people stall.*

#### [Communication Habits for Software Engineers](./career/communication-habits.md)  
*Spoiler: Clear updates beat “quick syncs” and Slack novels every time. Your calendar and your team will thank you.*

#### [Lessons Learned from Working with a Career Coach](./career/career-coaching.md)  
*Spoiler: A good coach won’t give you answers. They’ll force you to ask better questions (and finally fix what’s holding you back).*

#### [1:1s Done Right](./career/1:1.md)  
*Spoiler: If your 1:1s feel pointless, you’re either talking too much or not enough. Here’s how to make them count.*

### Technical

#### [System Design: What Really Matters](./technical/system-design.md)  
*Spoiler: You don’t need a thousand patterns. You need to know how to think when tradeoffs get real.*

#### [Great Code: What Really Matters](./technical/great-code.md)  
*Spoiler: It’s not about clever tricks. It’s about writing code your future self (and your teammates) won’t curse at.*

#### [Coding with AI: Context Engineering for Developers](./technical/coding-with-ai.md)  
*Spoiler: AI can’t replace you, but it can make you faster, sharper, and way more dangerous (in the good way).*

#### [Debug Like a Pro](./technical/debug.md)  
*Spoiler: Great engineers don’t panic. They debug with a plan—and a checklist that actually works.*

#### [The Mindset of Great Software Engineers](./technical/engineering-mindset.md)  
*Spoiler: It’s not raw IQ that sets great engineers apart. It’s curiosity, resilience, and the willingness to be wrong (a lot).*
