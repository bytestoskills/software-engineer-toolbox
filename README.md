# Welcome to the Playground

## What This Repo Is About

This is not just another collection of tech notes or half-baked tutorials.  
This repo is our personal toolbox—a growing collection of insights, habits, systems, and reflections we've gathered through years of experience (and, let’s be honest, some hard lessons too).

The mission?  
To help software engineers **level up**, technically, strategically, and professionally.  
Whether you're early in your career or operating at Staff+ level, you’ll find something useful, actionable, or at least thought-provoking in here.

We update this repo regularly.  
New ideas, new strategies, new habits. All tested in the real world, shared here so you don’t have to learn everything the hard way.

So yeah… bookmark this.

## Want to Give Your Future Self a Gift?

Hey, we’re engineers, so let’s skip the marketing talk.

Over the years, we found that what moved the needle in our careers wasn’t just code. It was how we communicated, learned, made decisions, and handled complexity.

That’s what this little gift is about: 7 skills we wish we had learned earlier, bundled into one no-nonsense guide.

## Let’s See What You Can Learn from Us

Here’s what’s inside the toolbox so far:

### [Communication Habits for Software Engineers](./communication-habits.md)  
Because great engineers don’t just ship code—they ship clarity. Learn how to write short, sharp updates your PM and director will actually want to read.

### [Coding with AI: The Developer’s Playbook](./coding-with-ai.md)  
Still just asking ChatGPT to “write a Python function”? Come on. Let’s go deeper. This guide teaches you how to think, code, refactor, and debug *with* AI like a pro.

### [The Anatomy of a Great Tech Resume](./tech-resume.md)  
What makes a resume stand out in a pile of 300? This is the no-fluff breakdown

*(More coming soon… and they’ll be just as useful. Stay tuned.)*
