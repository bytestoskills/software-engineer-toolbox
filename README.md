# Let's Grow Together.

## 🧠 What This Repo Is About

This is a collection of hard-earned lessons, sharp tools, habits, systems, and real-world strategies to help software engineers grow, not just in code, but in career.  
Whether you're aiming for cleaner systems or clearer communication, you'll find something here to level up how you think, build, and lead.

## ⚙️ How to Make the Most of This Repo

Start with whatever grabs your attention, maybe it's debugging, maybe it's writing better emails, or 1:1s. Each page is designed to stand on its own, so you don’t need to read them in order or all at once.
Skim, learn, try something. Come back later when you're stuck or bored or chasing that next promotion.

## Want to Give Your Future Self a Gift?

Hey, we’re engineers, so let’s skip the marketing talk.
Over the years, we found that what moved the needle in our careers wasn’t just code. It was how we communicated, learned, made decisions, and handled complexity.
That’s what this little gift is about: 7 skills we wish we had learned earlier, bundled into one no-nonsense guide.

#### [`career/technical-leadership.md`](./career/technical-leadership.md)  
**Technical Leadership: What Really Matters**
