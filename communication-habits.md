## How to Get the Most Out of This Page

**We know reading isn't everyone's favorite debugging method.**\
That's why we made a short video explaining how to use this page and get the most out of it, without falling asleep.

## Email: Alignment

**Before building anything, align.**\
I’ve learned that writing a clear alignment email before starting the actual work can save days of rework and a dozen confused DMs. It gives stakeholders a chance to weigh in early and gives me a clear green light to proceed.

### Guidelines:

- **Keep it short.** One screen is enough.
- **Use structure.** People skim.
- **Stick to facts and plans.** Keep opinions and guesses in a separate thread.
- **Invite feedback.** You’re not declaring, you’re aligning.

### Example template:

```
Subject: Alignment on [Project or Task Name]

Hey team,

Here's a quick alignment on [task/project name].

What we're solving:
[Brief explanation]

How I plan to approach it:
[Key steps, tools, or design idea]

What could go wrong:
[Uncertainties, dependencies, or potential blockers]

If you see something I’m missing, happy to adjust before I dive in.

Thanks,  
[Your Name]
```

## Email: Clarifying Requirements

**Sometimes requirements are vague. Or incomplete. Or changing while you're typing.**\
Rather than guess, I send short clarification emails to surface the unknowns and reduce the risk of building the wrong thing.

### Guidelines:

- **List what you do know.** Start from shared understanding.
- **Ask specific questions.** Open-ended leads to confusion.
- **Group by area.** UX questions, logic questions, edge cases.
- **Be polite, but assertive.** You're here to build the right thing.

### Example template:

```
Subject: Clarifying Requirements for [Feature or Ticket Name]

Hey [Product/Design/Team],

Before I move forward with [feature/ticket], I want to make sure we're aligned.

Here's what I understand so far:
- [Bullet 1: Known piece of info]
- [Bullet 2: Another known piece]

What’s unclear to me:
- [Question 1]
- [Question 2]

Happy to jump on a quick call if needed, otherwise I’ll wait for your input before moving ahead.

Thanks!  
[Your Name]
```

## Writing Wiki: System / Project Overview

**A good wiki makes your future self, and your team, say *****thank you*****.**\
A bad one becomes noise. Here's how I make mine useful without turning it into a novel.

### Guidelines:

- **Start with a TL;DR:** Give people a summary at the top.
- **Use headings and bullets:** Walls of text are an instant nope.
- **Make it skimmable:** Structure over style.
- **Add context, not just instructions:** Help readers understand *why* something matters.
- **Link, don't duplicate:** Reuse what already exists.
- **Keep it alive:** Update it when major changes happen.

### Wiki skeleton:

```
# [Feature / System Name]

## TL;DR
A short summary of what this is, who uses it, and why it matters.

## Overview
What this system does and how it fits in the big picture.

## Key Concepts
- Concept 1
- Concept 2

## Flows
Document the key flows (user, system, data) that matter most.

## How It Works
High-level architecture or flow.

## Setup / Usage
Instructions to run, test, or integrate.

## Resources
Links to code, dashboards, alerts, Slack channels, etc.
```

## Writing Wiki: Technical Decisions

**Technical decisions shape your codebase, and your future debugging nightmares.**\
Writing them down helps future devs (and you) understand *why* something was done a certain way. No more "git blame" archaeology.

### Guidelines:

- **Capture the why.** Context is everything.
- **List options.** Show what was considered, not just what was chosen.
- **Be honest about trade-offs.** There are always some.
- **Keep it simple.** This isn’t a whitepaper, it’s a memo.

### Decision Log Template:

```
# Technical Decision: [Decision Title]

## Context
Explain the situation or problem that required a decision.

## Options Considered
- Option A: pros/cons
- Option B: pros/cons

## Decision
Summarize the chosen approach and rationale.

## Impact
Trade-offs, risks, follow-ups, or what this unblocks.
```
