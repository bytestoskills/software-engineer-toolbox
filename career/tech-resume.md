# The Anatomy of a Great Tech Resume

Your resume isn’t a life story. It’s a signal. A single page (maybe two) to show what you’ve done, how you think, and why you might be a great fit. It should start conversations, not try to finish them.

If you're here, you're probably a developer looking to level up your resume. Let’s walk through what makes a resume good, what kills it, what actually matters when people like me review it, and how to make yours stand out.

## Good Resume / Bad Resume

These patterns show up all the time. Here’s what helps your resume get noticed, and what gets it quietly closed.

**Good Resume: Focuses on outcomes**\
Describes what changed because of your work: performance improved, incidents dropped, conversion rates increased. There’s a before and after.

**Bad Resume: Lists tasks**\
Reads like a job description. “Wrote backend endpoints using Go.” Okay, but… did those endpoints matter?

**Good Resume: Customized for the role**\
Mentions relevant tools, frameworks, or business context. It feels like you care about this specific job.

**Bad Resume: Generic and reused everywhere**\
Mentions every tool under the sun and feels like it was shipped to 20 companies with zero editing.

**Good Resume: Uses simple, active language**\
Clear verbs like “led,” “built,” “designed,” and “reduced.” Easy to scan and quickly understand.

**Bad Resume: Full of fluff or passive voice**\
“Participated in project for delivering improvements to application logic.” What does that even mean?

**Good Resume: Clean and skimmable**\
Logical sections. Bullet points. Clear formatting. Recruiters and engineers can read it in 20 seconds and get the gist.

**Bad Resume: Dense and chaotic**\
Long paragraphs, inconsistent spacing, multiple fonts. You’re making it harder to see your value.

**Good Resume: Provides real examples**\
Mentions things like “Improved latency by 30% on key API used by 70% of users.”

**Bad Resume: Talks in vague terms**\
“Solved performance issues” - great, but which ones? How did you know they were solved?

## Red Flags

These are patterns that raise eyebrows. No single one will sink your resume, but a few together could land it in the “maybe later (probably never)” pile.

**Buzzword overload**\
It’s tempting to name-drop everything you’ve touched. But a wall of tech terms with no context suggests padding. Focus on the core stack you used and what you *did* with those tools.

**Exaggerated titles or responsibilities**\
If you were a mid-level developer, don’t call yourself “Technical Lead” because you merged someone’s PR once. Overselling damages trust quickly.

**Overly long**\
Unless you’re applying for a senior leadership role, your resume should fit on one or two pages max. If we’re reading page three and still trying to figure out what you’re great at, that’s a problem.

**Unclear role progression**\
If you list four roles in three years and there’s no explanation (like promotions, company shifts, or contract work), the signal can get fuzzy. Help the reader understand your path.

**Too vague**\
Avoid “Contributed to important projects” or “Involved in critical systems.” Be specific. What did you do, and why did it matter?

**Irrelevant tech history**\
If you haven’t touched COBOL, PHP 5.6, or Flash in over a decade, leave them out. Focus on what’s relevant today.

## What Really Matters

When experienced engineers or hiring managers review resumes, they’re looking for signal, not a list of everything you’ve done, but signs of how you think and what you contribute. These are the things that make that signal strong.

**Impact**\
We want to know: what changed because of you? Did users get a faster experience? Did incidents drop? Did other teams unblock? Show how your work made things better.

**Results**\
It’s one thing to say you worked on a migration. It’s another to say, “Completed database migration with zero downtime, improving query times by 20%.” We’re looking for measurable outcomes: numbers, timelines, or user wins.

**Ownership**\
When something broke or a project stalled, did you step up? Ownership means you didn’t just do what you were told, you identified gaps, solved problems, and drove things forward. Hiring managers love builders who take initiative.

**Mentorship**\
If you’ve mentored juniors, helped onboard new team members, or run code walkthroughs, that’s high signal. It shows you're a multiplier, not just good at what you do, but someone who lifts the team.

**Collaboration**\
Resumes that show cross-team or cross-functional collaboration stand out. If you worked with design, product, or external partners, mention it. Building good software is a team effort, show that you’re good at the team part.

**Problem Solving**\
Complexity is part of the job. Whether you debugged a thorny race condition or designed a clean workaround under pressure, tell us. Describe the problem, the constraints, and what you did. It shows how you think, and that you don’t fold under pressure.

**Readable**\
The layout and clarity of your resume send a subtle message: “I can communicate well.” A clear, skimmable structure with consistent formatting signals maturity and care. Make it easy for people to see your strengths — don’t make them dig.

## How to Stand Out

Once your resume is clear, well-structured, and focused on what matters, here’s how to go the extra mile.

**Tailor your resume for the job**\
This doesn’t mean rewriting the whole thing, but tweak your summary, emphasize relevant experiences, and use some of the same language from the job description. It shows you’re intentional and thoughtful.

**Showcase side projects and open source**\
Even small personal projects or OSS contributions show curiosity, self-direction, and practical skills. If it’s relevant, even better, like a side project that explores a domain the company works in.

**Highlight skills beyond code**\
Mention skills that aren’t strictly technical but still vital: writing clear documentation, running retrospectives, facilitating meetings, coordinating rollouts, teaching teammates. These skills show leadership and maturity.

**Demonstrate product thinking**\
If you’ve worked closely with product managers, done user testing, or made decisions based on business goals, say so. Engineers who understand the “why” behind what they’re building are rare and valuable.

**Show your range**\
Did you lead a tech talk, write internal tools, or contribute to incident response? A mix of experiences makes you more memorable, and often more hireable.

**Include meaningful links**\
If you’ve got a GitHub, personal site, blog, or even a specific project you’re proud of, add the link. Make it easy for the reviewer to see your work in action, but only include what’s up-to-date and worth showing.
