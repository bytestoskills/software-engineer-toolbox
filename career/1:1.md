# 1:1s Done Right  

Most developers treat 1:1s like status updates. That’s a waste. Your manager already knows what you’re working on, they get reports, dashboards, and enough Jira boards to haunt their dreams. A 1:1 isn’t about telling them you fixed bug #4321. It’s about you.  

A good 1:1 is your time to grow, get feedback, and build alignment. Think of it as career gym time. Skip it or phone it in, and you’ll stagnate. Show up prepared and intentional, and you’ll see real progress.

## Your Role in the Meeting  

Don’t walk into a 1:1 waiting for your manager to run the show. This isn’t a team meeting, it’s your slot. Come with topics, questions, and things you want to dig into. If you don’t steer the agenda, someone else will, and odds are, you won’t like where it goes.  

A simple trick: keep a running doc. Jot down things during the week that feel confusing, frustrating, or worth discussing. By the time the meeting rolls around, you’ve got a ready-made list. No blank stares, no wasted time.

## What Actually Matters  

Three big themes usually make 1:1s worthwhile:  

**Growth.** Talk about where you want to head, and what skills you should build to get there. Ask about opportunities, upcoming projects, or stretch work.  

**Feedback.** Don’t just hope your manager drops truth bombs on you, ask for it. Be specific: “What’s one thing I could do better in code reviews?” And when you get feedback, don’t let it evaporate. Act on it, and circle back later.  

**Alignment.** Are you working on the right things? Do you know what “good” looks like for this quarter? A 1:1 is the place to clear up fuzziness before it snowballs into bigger problems.

## Using Feedback the Right Way  

Collecting feedback is easy. Doing something with it is the hard part. If your manager says you need to “be more proactive,” don’t just nod. Ask for examples. Clarify what success looks like. And then, here’s the part people forget, bring it back in a future 1:1. Show what you tried, ask if you’re on track, and keep the loop alive. That’s how feedback actually becomes growth.

## Pitfalls to Avoid  

The fastest way to waste a 1:1 is to turn it into a status update. You’ve got Slack for that. Another trap: showing up with nothing. A blank agenda usually leads to shallow conversations that don’t move the needle. And the worst one? Sitting there like a passenger, waiting for your manager to solve your career for you. Spoiler: they won’t.

## Making It Stick  

Keep it lightweight but consistent. A one-pager doc with topics and notes is enough. Circle back on career topics regularly, not once a year when performance reviews sneak up. Treat each 1:1 as a checkpoint: am I growing, am I aligned, am I actually using feedback?  

Because here’s the truth: 1:1s are only as good as the effort you put in. Own them, prep for them, and they’ll become one of the most valuable hours in your week. Sleepwalk through them, and you’ll wonder why nothing ever changes.
