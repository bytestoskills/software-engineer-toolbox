# 1:1s Done Right  

Most developers treat 1:1s like status updates. That’s a waste. Your manager already knows what you’re working on. They get reports, dashboards, and enough Jira boards to haunt their dreams. A 1:1 isn’t about telling them you fixed bug #4321. It’s about you.  

A good 1:1 is your time to grow, get feedback, and build alignment. Think of it as career gym time: you get stronger only if you show up and put in the work. Skip it or sleepwalk through it, and you’ll stagnate. Use it intentionally, and you’ll walk away with clarity, momentum, and sometimes even new opportunities.

## Your Role in the Meeting  

One common mistake is assuming your manager owns the 1:1. They don’t. Sure, they’ll have things to discuss, but the real value comes when you take ownership. This is the rare meeting in your calendar that’s just for you. No deadlines, no sprint commitments, no tickets attached. Treat it as such.  

That means preparation. Spend ten minutes before the meeting writing down what’s on your mind: challenges, blockers, things you’re learning, things you want more of. If you don’t steer the agenda, your manager will and their agenda will often revolve around company priorities, not your growth.  

A simple system: keep a running doc. Add items during the week whenever something feels confusing, frustrating, or worth digging into. By the time the meeting arrives, you’ve got a natural agenda. No awkward silences, no shallow conversations. It also creates a paper trail, which makes it easy to spot long-term patterns.

## What Actually Matters  

When you strip away the noise, three themes consistently make 1:1s worth it: growth, feedback, and alignment.  

**Growth.** Talk about your career direction. Where do you want to be in a year? What skills should you sharpen to get there? Managers can’t read minds. If you don’t voice your aspirations, they can’t help you find opportunities. A 1:1 is the safest space to ask about stretch projects, new responsibilities, or what it would take to get promoted.  

**Feedback.** Don’t sit around waiting for your manager to drop insights on you. Ask for it. Be specific: “What’s one thing I could do better in code reviews?” or “How did I handle that last incident response?” Broad questions get vague answers; sharp questions get useful ones. And feedback is wasted if you don’t follow up on it.  

**Alignment.** Half of workplace frustration comes from mismatched expectations. Are you working on the most impactful things? Do you understand how success will be measured this quarter? 1:1s are the time to cut through assumptions. If something feels fuzzy, ask. Small misalignments can snowball into bigger conflicts later.

## Using Feedback the Right Way  

Feedback is fuel, but only if you burn it. Collecting it is the easy part; acting on it is where growth happens. If your manager says, “You need to be more proactive,” don’t just nod politely and move on. That’s too vague to be actionable. Ask for examples: *What did I do (or not do) that led you to say this? What would ‘proactive’ look like in practice?*  

Once you have specifics, try them. Experiment. Then, in a future 1:1, bring it back. “Last time we talked, you said I should take more initiative in design reviews. I tried leading two sessions this sprint. Did that move in the right direction?” This closes the loop and shows you’re serious about improvement. Managers notice that.  

Feedback that never gets revisited just floats into the ether. Feedback that’s tested, refined, and followed up on becomes the foundation for growth.

## Pitfalls to Avoid  

The easiest way to ruin a 1:1 is to turn it into a status report. That’s what project updates, dashboards, and stand-ups are for. If you waste this slot rehashing Jira tickets, you’ll walk out with nothing but boredom.  

Another classic trap: showing up unprepared. Without an agenda, conversations default to small talk or surface-level updates. You get 30 minutes of polite nodding, and then another week slips by with zero progress.  

And the worst one: being passive. Sitting there like a passenger, waiting for your manager to magically chart your career path. Spoiler alert, they won’t. Good managers can guide you, but they can’t drive the car for you. If you’re not steering, you’re drifting.

## Making It Stick  

A 1:1 isn’t magic. The value comes from consistency. Keep it simple: a one-pager doc with three columns: topics, notes, and follow-ups. Use it to track what you bring up, what’s discussed, and what you’ll do next. This not only keeps you honest, but also reminds your manager of the things you’re serious about.  

Career topics shouldn’t appear once a year when performance reviews creep up. Revisit them regularly. Are you building the skills you said you wanted to? Did you follow up on the feedback from last month? Did your priorities shift?  

Treat 1:1s as checkpoints. Growth, alignment, feedback. Week after week, small adjustments compound. Over time, you’ll notice the difference: fewer missteps, more clarity, faster growth.  

Because here’s the truth: 1:1s are only as good as the effort you put in. Own them, prepare for them, and they’ll become one of the most valuable hours in your week. Sleepwalk through them, and you’ll wonder why nothing ever changes.
