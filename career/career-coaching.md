# Lessons Learned from Working with a Career Coach  

I didn’t start working with a career coach because I was burned out or lost. I started because I wanted clarity. After years of building systems, leading projects, and mentoring others, I realized I wasn’t entirely sure what I wanted next. I could keep shipping code and collecting promotions, but that didn’t automatically mean progress.  

So I decided to talk to someone outside the tech bubble, someone who wasn’t impressed by architecture diagrams or deployment stories, but who could ask better questions. Months later, I came out with a few lessons that stuck with me, ideas that changed how I approach my career, my decisions, and even how I think about growth.

## You Can’t Optimize What You Don’t Understand  
I’ve spent most of my career trying to optimize things, code, processes, systems, team workflows. But it hit me one day that I’d never really optimized *myself*. I was making decisions reactively: new role, new project, new company. No clear metric, no baseline.  

Working with a coach forced me to slow down and look inward with the same curiosity I bring to debugging production issues. What are my actual strengths? What energizes me? What consistently drains me? I realized that I was trying to improve a system I hadn’t properly observed.  

Once I started to understand my own patterns, how I handle pressure, where I do my best thinking, what kind of work gives me a sense of flow, everything became easier to reason about. The lesson was simple: you can’t optimize what you don’t understand. And most of us never take the time to understand ourselves.

## Feedback Is a Shortcut (If You Know How to Use It)  
Before coaching, I treated feedback like a performance review grenade. I waited for it to happen once or twice a year and braced for impact. The experience taught me that this was a slow and painful way to grow.  

The faster way is to make feedback continuous and directional. I started asking smaller questions more often, *“How did that meeting land for you?”*, *“Did this doc make sense?”*, *“What’s one thing I could’ve done better?”* The magic wasn’t just in getting feedback but in spotting patterns over time.  

The real shift, though, came when I learned to separate data from emotion. Not every comment is right, but almost every one is useful. Once I stopped treating feedback as a threat, it became the fastest path to improvement. It’s like monitoring for your own career, you just have to be willing to read the logs.

## Influence Is Built, Not Given  
There was a point in my career where I believed influence came with seniority. You become Staff, you lead bigger projects, and suddenly people just follow your lead. Except… that’s not how it works.  

Influence isn’t about title or visibility. It’s about trust. It’s about how you make others feel when you explain an idea or challenge one. It’s about consistency, doing what you said you’d do, and helping others succeed along the way.  

Through coaching, I learned that influence grows quietly. You build it through empathy, patience, and clarity. And once you have it, you can use it to make things better, not just for yourself, but for your team, your org, and sometimes the whole company.

## You Don’t Need Permission to Lead Yourself  
One of the hardest habits I had to break was waiting for someone else to define my next step. A new manager, a reorg, a new project, something external to push me forward. Coaching helped me realize how much of my career I was outsourcing to circumstance.  

Leading yourself means setting direction before someone else does it for you. It means managing your own energy, setting boundaries, and taking ownership of your time. It’s not glamorous, but it’s liberating.  

I started treating my own growth like a long-term project: I wrote down goals, measured progress, and even did retrospectives. I stopped expecting my manager to “develop” me. That’s when my trajectory really changed.

## Reflection Is an Engineering Tool  
Most engineers will run a detailed postmortem after an outage but never run one on themselves. I was no different. I’d analyze failures in systems but rarely reflected on my own patterns, what led to burnout, what made collaboration harder, what environments made me perform at my best.  

Regular reflection changed that. It became my personal observability system. Every few weeks, I’d write down what went well, what didn’t, and what I learned. Sometimes it took ten minutes, sometimes an hour. Over time, these notes became a roadmap, a living record of how I think, grow, and adapt.  

The point isn’t to be poetic or journal daily. It’s to stay aware. If you can reflect on your work with the same honesty you apply to debugging code, you’ll always be moving in the right direction.

## Growth Isn’t Linear (and That’s Okay)  
For most of my career, I believed growth followed a straight line: junior → mid → senior → staff → principal → ???. Every move was supposed to be “up.” But life and careers don’t really work like that.  

Some of my biggest leaps came from lateral moves, taking a less glamorous project, switching teams, or exploring something completely new. At first, those steps felt like detours. But later, I realized they were compounding into something deeper: range, perspective, adaptability.  

The lesson here was to stop obsessing over trajectory and start focusing on momentum. Progress doesn’t always mean promotion. Sometimes it means staying curious, staying sharp, and keeping your edge.

## Final Note  
A coach didn’t give me answers. They gave me perspective, and sometimes, the right questions. The rest came from doing the work: thinking, reflecting, adjusting, and learning to lead myself with intent.  

If I had to sum it up, I’d say this: your career is an engineering system. It’ll drift if you don’t monitor it, and it’ll stagnate if you don’t refactor it.  
Take time to look under the hood.
