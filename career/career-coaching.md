# Lessons Learned from Working with a Career Coach  

## Setting the Stage  
I’ve been writing code for long enough to know that the hardest problems in this job aren’t just technical. You reach a point where you can debug systems, ship features, and handle incidents without breaking a sweat, and yet you feel stuck. The question becomes less about *“How do I solve this ticket?”* and more about *“Where am I going with this career?”*  

That’s the question that pushed me to work with a career coach. Not because I was lost, but because I wanted clarity. And looking back, it was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself.  

## What I Learned  

**Clarity Beats Hustle**  
For most of my career, I believed hustle was the answer. More hours, more code, more projects. And yes, hard work gets you far. But there’s a ceiling. Hustle without direction is just running in circles. A coach forced me to ask the questions I kept avoiding: *What am I optimizing for? Where do I want to be in three years?* Once I had clarity, the noise died down. Suddenly, it was easier to drop low-value work and double down on the things that actually moved me toward my goals.  

**Your Story Matters More Than Your Commits**  
This one was a wake-up call. As engineers, we like to think the work speaks for itself. Spoiler: it doesn’t. Promotions, interviews, opportunities, none of them come from people digging through your Git history. They come from how you tell your story. Not in a fake, marketing kind of way, but in a way that connects the dots: here’s what I did, here’s the impact, here’s why it mattered. Learning to tell that story wasn’t about bragging; it was about making my work visible and meaningful.  

**Feedback Is Just Data**  
I used to treat feedback like a performance review grenade. If it was positive, I relaxed. If it was negative, I got defensive. A coach flipped that mindset on its head: feedback is data, not judgment. It’s raw input you can choose to act on. The trick is to get it early and small: *“What’s one thing I could do better in this design doc?”* or *“How did that meeting land for you?”* That kind of feedback compounds. It’s a cheap shortcut compared to learning everything the hard way.  

**Soft Skills Are Multipliers**  
Early in my career, I thought soft skills were optional, nice to have, but not the real work. Turns out, they’re multipliers. The higher you go, the less it’s about who can write the tightest code and the more it’s about who can align a team, explain trade-offs, and influence decisions. Writing a design doc that people actually want to read, framing risks in a way that a PM or director can understand, helping a junior grow. These things scale your impact far more than another clever optimization.  

**Success Needs Your Definition**  
This one hit me hardest. A lot of the goals I was chasing weren’t mine. They were borrowed from peers, managers, or whatever LinkedIn was preaching that week. A coach helped me slow down and define what success actually means *for me*. Not the default ladder. Not someone else’s version of “making it.” Once I had my own definition, career decisions got simpler. Saying no got easier. And the feeling of running on autopilot finally went away.  

**Growth Isn’t Always a Promotion**  
Maybe the most surprising lesson: growth doesn’t always mean moving up. Sometimes growth means going sideways into a different area, deepening an expertise, or even taking a role that looks “smaller” on paper but opens doors in the long run. A coach helped me see growth as expanding range, not just climbing ladders. And that shift took a lot of unnecessary pressure off.  

## Closing  
I didn’t come out of coaching with a ten-step plan or a brand-new personality. What I came away with was perspective: clarity about what matters, a sharper way to frame my story, and the reminder that my career is mine to define.  

And that’s the point of this doc: you don’t need a coach to start applying these lessons. You just need time to reflect, the courage to ask better questions, and the discipline to listen to the answers.
