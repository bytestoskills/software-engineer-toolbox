# Lessons Learned from Working with a Career Coach  

## Why I Tried a Career Coach  
I’ve been around the block as a software engineer. Shipped enough code, dealt with enough incidents, sat in enough design reviews. At some point, the challenge wasn’t the code anymore, it was figuring out *what’s next*. Do I want to go deeper into tech? Move into leadership? Or just survive another round of corporate re-orgs without losing my mind?  

That’s when I decided to work with a career coach. Not because I was lost, but because I wanted perspective. And honestly, it turned out to be one of the best professional decisions I’ve made in years.  

## What I Learned  

The first thing I learned is that **clarity beats hustle**. For years, I believed that putting in more hours, grinding harder, and shipping faster would automatically move me forward. It did, up to a point. But then I realized I was running without knowing the destination. A coach forced me to pause and answer uncomfortable questions: *What am I optimizing for? Where do I want to be in three years?* Once I had clarity, the noise got quieter. I stopped saying yes to every project and started choosing the ones that matched my long-term goals.  

Then there’s the idea that **your story matters more than your code**. As engineers, we love to let our work “speak for itself.” Reality check: it doesn’t. Your code doesn’t sit in promotion packets, your impact does. A coach helped me practice telling my story, not as bragging, but as connecting the dots between what I did and why it mattered. That shift alone changed the way I show up in reviews, performance discussions, and even interviews.  

I also learned that **feedback isn’t a performance review grenade**. For most of my career, I treated feedback as a verdict. If it was good, I relaxed. If it was bad, I felt attacked. Coaching flipped that mindset: feedback is just raw data. The trick is to ask for it early, often, and in small doses. *“What’s one thing I can improve in how I run meetings?”* That kind of feedback compounds, and it saves you from walking blindly into the same mistakes.  

Another big one: **soft skills are force multipliers, not side quests**. Early in my career, I thought communication and visibility were distractions from the “real work.” But the higher you go, the more your ability to influence, align, and explain matters. Writing a crisp design doc, summarizing risks in a single email, or helping a PM see trade-offs, those are not extras. They’re the levers that separate a senior engineer from a Staff or Principal.  

And finally: **success is yours to define**. This one is simple, but it hit me harder than I expected. I realized a lot of my career goals weren’t even mine, they were borrowed from peers, managers, or the LinkedIn feed. Working with a coach forced me to define what *my* version of success looks like, not the industry’s default. And once you define that, decisions get easier.  

## How to Apply This Without a Coach  
Here’s the good news: you don’t need to pay someone to start applying these lessons. Write down your goals and check if they’re actually yours, not borrowed from your peers or LinkedIn. Tell your career story out loud, even if just to a friend, and notice the gaps. Ask your teammates for feedback in one sentence: *“What’s one thing I could do better?”* And start treating your communication habits like part of your engineering toolkit, not an optional plugin.

Some engineers refactor code. Others refactor their careers. If you’re into both, this [website](https://www.bytestoskills.co/)  might be your next rabbit hole.
